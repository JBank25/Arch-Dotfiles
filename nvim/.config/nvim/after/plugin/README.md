### telecope

The key bindings here can be used to search for
files within the project and to grep through
the project. Both of these operations are interactive and will display a few windows. 

One of the windows where be where you input the thing you are
searching for whether that is a file or a grep pattern of some
sort, one will be the preview window of the file, and the last
will be the list of the files.

To navigate inside the window displaying files, make sure
you are in normal mode then use j and k to go up or down.

`ctrl-p` is used to fuzzy find files
`<leader>fg` is used to grep thru a project
